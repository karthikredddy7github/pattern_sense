Pattern Sense: Classifying Fabric Patterns using Deep Learning
Pattern Sense: Classifying Fabric Patterns using Deep Learning is a project designed to automate the process of identifying and categorizing fabric patterns using advanced deep learning techniques. The system can be used in various industries such as fashion, textiles, and interior design to streamline pattern recognition tasks.

Scenario 1:Fashion Industry

In the fashion industry, designers and manufacturers often deal with a wide range of fabric patterns. Pattern Sense can automatically classify different patterns like stripes, polka dots, floral prints, and geometric designs, saving time and effort in manual categorization.



Scenario 2: Textile Quality Control

Textile companies can use Pattern Sense for quality control purposes. By analyzing fabric patterns, the system can detect any irregularities or defects in the patterns, ensuring that only high-quality fabrics are sent for production or distribution.



Scenario 3: Interior Design

Interior designers frequently work with fabric patterns for furniture, curtains, and upholstery. Pattern Sense can assist designers in quickly identifying and selecting suitable fabric patterns that match their design concepts, leading to more efficient project workflows.
